# adpt work discontinued in favour of DAPT

The work done here on adpt has been used at least in part as the basis for [DAPT](https://www.w3.org/TR/dapt/),
under development by the [Timed Text Working Group](https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/#recent-activity).
DAPT's scope additionally includes the creation of dubbing scripts.

No further work is expected on ADPT.

The Audio Description Profile of TTML2, by the [Timed Text Working Group](https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/#recent-activity) 
is a profile of TTML2 suitable for the scripting, voicing and audio mixing of audio descriptions for videos.
This work was originally made by the [Audio Description Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/audio-description/), and contributions can be made also via the [W3C Audio Description Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/audio-description/).

It is intended to meet the requirements set out in the [Requirements for Audio Description](https://github.com/w3c/ttml2/wiki/Audio-Description-Requirements), currently residing in the TTML2 repo's wiki space.
